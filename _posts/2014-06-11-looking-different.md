Feels nice to see Apple not only looking fresh and charged up, but also
open and developer-friendly after WWDC 2014.

Apart from making many dev wishlist items come true, a lot of the new
APIs enables us to do things that were quite unimaginable before.

And, the legal conditions for talking about Apple beta products publicly
is now [sane][oleb]. It's as if a weight is off. Swift and the iOS 8 API
are being discussed freely in Stack Overflow. And, many engineers
currently working at Apple are actively participating in Twitter,
talking about the just-announced dev stuff. And they are not like
Developer Relations people, but folks who have actually created the
backend for these new APIs.

It's as if we suddenly realize that Apple has been listening all along
to its dev community, but just took it's time to deliver.
