[Brent Simmons described][] a problem he faced when adopting
protocol-oriented programming with Swift 2.0. (To follow along, please
read his post in full before continuing with this post.)

The crux of the problem is that equality between two values of a custom
type is not implicit in Swift. So, with a custom type `Feed`, it's not
possible out of the box to check if an array of feeds contains a
particular feed - we first need to tell Swift what it means to say two
feeds are the same.

The quick Objective-C version that Brent wrote does have a similar
problem as well, though it's less obvious.

### The Objective-C version

In the Objective-C version of the project, I'm assuming both `Feed` and
`Folder` would be defined as Objective-C protocols, and we'd have
`LocalFeed` and `LocalFolder` as `NSObject`-based Objective-C classes
conforming to those protocols respectively.

Brent's Objective-C version of `addFeeds` (in say `LocalFolder`)
looks like this:

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)addFeeds:(NSArray *)feedsToAdd {
  NSMutableArray *feedsArray = [self.feeds mutableCopy];
  for (id<Feed> oneFeed in feedsToAdd) {
    if (![feedsArray containsObject:oneFeed]) {
      [feedsArray addObject:oneFeed];
    }
  }
  self.feeds = [feedsArray copy];
}
{% endhighlight %}

`self.feeds` contains the feeds that are already in the local folder.
`feedsToAdd` contains the feeds that we'd like to add to the folder.
It's likely that the objects in `feedsToAdd` were created at a different
point in time than the objects already in `self.feeds`.  The default
equality checking in `NSObject` is to check for the equality of
pointers, so `addFeeds` wouldn't work correctly if the feed urls are the
same, but the object addresses are different.

One way to fix this problem is to override `isEqual:` for `LocalFeed`
to check the equality of the feed urls rather than memory addresses.
This would override the implicit equality checking with the equality
checking that we really want.

(**Update 22/Jul/2015:** [Brent clarified][brent's twitter reply] that pointer
equality was really what he wanted.)

Also, I think the concept of a feed is more like a struct than a class.
But there's no way for a value type to conform to a protocol in
Objective-C, so we are forced to make `LocalFeed` a class here.

### Let's Swift

This is how I would model this scenario in Swift.

A feed is anything that has `url` as a gettable property.

{% highlight swift %}
protocol Feed {
    var url: String { get }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`LocalFeed` is a value type conforming to the `Feed` protocol.

{% highlight swift %}
struct LocalFeed: Feed {
    var url: String
    init(url: String) {
        self.url = url
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We need to be able to check if a feed exists in an array, so we should
define what equality for feeds means. We do that by making the `Feed`
protocol inherit from the `Equatable` protocol.

The `Equatable` protocol requires that we implement a function with
signature `func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool`. The `Self` here
refers to the actual type conforming to the protocol (like `LocalFeed`)
that we're checking for equality. So, a function signature of `func
==(lhs: Feed, rhs: Feed) -> Bool` will not help us conform to
`Equatable`, because `Feed` is a protocol, not a type.

We should write a function that can take two values of a particular
type, where that type conforms to the `Feed` protocol. We can do that
using generics.

{% highlight swift %}
protocol Feed: Equatable {
    var url: String { get }
}

func ==<T: Feed>(lhs: T, rhs: T) -> Bool {
    return (lhs.url == rhs.url)
}
{% endhighlight %}

A folder contains a bunch of feeds.  We can have different types of
folders, and they would contain the corresponding types of feeds. For
example, a LocalFolder would contain a bunch of LocalFeeds, and a
FeedlyFolder would contain a bunch of FeedlyFeeds. It's not possible for
a FeedlyFolder to contain a FeedBinFeed.

To represent a bunch of feeds in a folder, let's use an array.
To represent an array of feeds, we might write `[Feed]`. But if we
really think about it, that's not correct because `Feed` is not a type -
it's a protocol. What we want is an array of values of a certain _type_,
where that type is a type that conforms to the `Feed` protocol.

We need a `typealias` to represent this. When we say `typealias
FeedType: Feed`, we create a placeholder type called `FeedType` that
conforms to the `Feed` protocol. We can then proceed to use `FeedType`
in further declarations in our definition of a folder.

{% highlight swift %}
protocol Folder {
    typealias FeedType: Feed
    var feeds: [FeedType] { get }
    func addFeeds(feedsToAdd: [FeedType])
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the type of the `feeds` property and the type of `feedsToAdd`
in the signature of `addFeeds` are now tied to each other. If you create
a type that conforms to the `Folder` protocol, these types must be the
_same types_.  They cannot be two different types, even if both of them
conform to the `Feed` protocol.

So, when we create a `LocalFolder` we need to use a specific type
conforming to the `Feed` protocol, rather than just saying `Feed`.

{% highlight swift %}
class LocalFolder: Folder {
    var feeds: [LocalFeed] = []
    func addFeeds(feedsToAdd: [LocalFeed]) {
        for oneFeed in feedsToAdd {
            if !feeds.contains(oneFeed) {
                feeds += [oneFeed]
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We can use it like this:

{% highlight swift %}
let folder = LocalFolder()
folder.addFeeds([ LocalFeed(url: "1"), LocalFeed(url: "2") ])
folder.addFeeds([ LocalFeed(url: "2"), LocalFeed(url: "3") ])
print(folder.feeds.count) // 3
{% endhighlight %}

[here](https://gist.github.com/roop/5bb4713110093e96adb1). 

Compared to Brent's original version, the only significant additional
code is the `==` function. But I would argue that likewise, we needed an
`isEqual:` in Objective-C to make it work correctly.

I'd love to hear your feedback on this, especially Brent's. You can find
