Brent Simmons, in a series of posts, argued the case for making Swift
more dynamic like Objective-C.

In [one of those posts][brent_summary], he summarizes his case as:

> I’m documenting problems that Mac and iOS developers solve using the
> dynamic features of the Objective-C runtime. [...]
>
> The point is that these problems will need solving in a possible
> future world without the Objective-C runtime. These kinds of problems

> good answers, better than (for instance) writing a script to generate
> some code.

Though we app developers rarely have to deal directly with the
Objective-C runtime, many frameworks we use do that in order to give us
powerful features in deceptively simple interfaces (like KVO and Core
Data). That, in turn, makes it easier for us to develop apps.

So the reduced dynamism in Swift doesn't affect us now, but it might hit
us many years (or decades) later, when eventually, Swift completely
supersedes Objective-C and Apple starts making Swift _frameworks_ that
are meant to be used only from Swift, and therefore don't use the
Objective-C runtime at all.

But I'm not too worried about it because I think Swift has a good
foundation to build its dynamism on. I share Brent Simmons' optimism in
[his earlier post][brent_optimism]:

I believe there's a way to evaluate how true Brent's optimistic
suspicion is: To look at Swift's internals at present and see if the
dynamism we desire can be built on top of it.

Internally, Swift class instances, even of pure Swift classes [^1], have
a memory layout that looks exactly like an Objective-C class instance -
with an `isa` pointer that points to a class object with a 
dispatch table (as Mike Ash [found out][mike_ash] early on). However,
while in Objective-C, all methods are listed in the dispatch table, in
Swift, only those methods marked `dynamic` are listed [^2]. Since Swift
guarantees that `dynamic` methods are never devirtualized, and since
`dynamic` is part of [Swift's library ABI goals][library_evolution], it's
highly likely that the dispatch table would remain in future Swift versions
as well.

The presence of this dispatch table would enable Objective-C-like
dynamic features to be built on top.  I'm reasonably hopeful that well
before it's time for Objective-C to be phased out, Swift would have
gained equivalent dynamic features, though maybe not with the same
interface. However, unlike Objective-C, the dynamism in Swift would
almost definitely remain disabled by default and would need to be
enabled for specific methods and properties using the `dynamic`
modifier.

A related fun observation: All pure Swift root classes have an `isa`
saying that they inherit from a `SwiftObject` class, which is at present
actually [written in Objective-C][SwiftObject.mm] [^3], conforming to the
`NSObject` protocol (and the code is designed to work even when
Swift-Objective-C-interoperability is not required i.e. when
`SWIFT_OBJC_INTEROP` is false).
Because of this, you can actually send `respondsToSelector:` to an
instance of a _pure Swift class_ to check for methods marked `dynamic`
(after casting to `AnyObject` to keep the compiler happy):

~~~
class C {
    func staticfn() { }
    dynamic func dynamicfn() { }
}
let c = C()
(c as! AnyObject).respondsToSelector("nonexistingfn") // false
(c as! AnyObject).respondsToSelector("staticfn") // false
(c as! AnyObject).respondsToSelector("dynamicfn") // true
~~~

Given how pure Swift classes closely resemble Objective-C classes
internally, I think Swift will eventually gain dynamic features
comparable to Objective-C, and I think that will happen well before
it's time for the Objective-C runtime to get sunsetted.

[^1]: What I call pure Swift classes are classes that are neither marked `@objc`, nor have `NSObject` as an ancestor

[^2]: I deduced this by using Mike Ash's code [here](https://github.com/mikeash/memorydumper)

[^3]: Because it's written in Objective-C, the runtime dynamism probably doesn't work on Linux (I don't know for sure because I haven't yet tried it on Linux), but that's not a problem for me as an app developer
