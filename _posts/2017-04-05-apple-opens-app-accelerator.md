Apple has just [opened] their [App Accelerator] in Bangalore, a city a
few hours drive away from where I live now. Phil Schiller was in the
city for the occasion.

[App Accelerator]: https://developer.apple.com/accelerator/

Foremost, the App Accelerator seems to be a sort of permanent
Apple Tech Talks venue. The first talks started yesterday, and the
schedule for the next few weeks covers mostly introductory topics,
leaning towards iOS (UI Design, Swift, Adaptive UI, Accessibility, i18n,
etc.). All slots for all scheduled presentations were already filled up
when I took a look last Friday (when the news broke). At present, the
talks seem to be only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so there's plenty of
room for more. I'd love to see in-depth talks on specific topics (say
Core Data, CloudKit or UIKit Animations). Phil Schiller mentioned that
the App Accelerator is also going to help developers in "learning how
better to market their app on the App Store", so there could be talks on
that topic as well, which would be very nice.

Apart from the talks, the website says there are going to be hands-on
labs, but no schedule is out yet.

Moreover, the App Accelerator could also serve as a place for Apple to
sit down and talk to some developers of apps it considers important. The
Apple announcement mentions [Practo](https://www.practo.com/) and
[Reliance Games](http://www.reliancegames.com/), and it [looks
like][loatweet] the [Legend of
Abhimanyu](http://www.legendofabhimanyu.com) team visited the App
Accelerator last week.

All in all, this is great news -- I'd find the talks and the labs very
useful.

I also think it shows how serious Apple is about a long-term play in the
Indian market. Phil Schiller, when [talking to NDTV][] last week, said
"I think what we hope from this accelerator is that we can help the
local market create apps for customers in India that better meet the
needs of our growing customer base here". There are tons of India
centric apps on Android, but not many on iOS, which is a reflection
of the Indian smartphone market being heavily skewed towards Android.
Getting more India-centric apps would be an important cog in Apple's
wheel for growing bigger in India.
