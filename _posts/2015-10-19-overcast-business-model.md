Marco Arment's [Overcast 2][overcast2] employs a "crazy new business
model" - basically a pay-if-you-can subscription.

[Some][opinion1] [folks][opinion2] [feel][opinion3] that this move makes
it unviable for other indie developers to make podcast apps, and that
Marco is uniquely positioned to benefit from a patronage-based business
model that can't be practically emulated by other indies.

Let's first take a look at Overcast's new business model in context of
the alternative revenue models available to us.

### What's behind the business model?

It's well known that targeting existing satisfied customers is a good
way to increase sales. But in the App Store, there is no straightforward
way to do that.

A commonly seen pattern is to release a major update of an app as a
separate paid app. Almost every time that happens, we see some customers
happily buying that update as a new app, but we alse see others who are
dissatisfied in having to pay again.

Wouldn't it be great if you could find a way to get the enthusiastic
customers, who don't mind paying, to pay more than the usual price, and
to make it a free upgrade to the those who don't want to pay more? What
if you could make up the drop in revenue (from those unhappy about
paying again) with the additional revenue from the enthusiastic
satisfied customers?

To me, it looks like Marco is trying effectively this: To get
more revenue from those who get a good amount value out of the app and
who'd be happy to pay more, while avoiding dissatisfaction in the rest
of the customers. He had tried something similar [with
Instapaper][instapaper1] earlier, though those donations were on top of
the paid-upfront price. The core idea is a time-bound patronage with a
pleasant user experience: make it easy to pay, make it easy to see till
when a user's patronage will stay in effect and make it easy to renew
the patronage.

Whether this would actually work in practice remains to be seen, but I
love the idea.

### Where can it be applied?

This can be useful only if applied for apps that have an established
customer base consisting of many satisfied customers, who regularly use
it and get good value out of the app. I can think of many such indie iOS
apps, but they would constitute only a small fraction of all indie iOS
apps.

Overcast's business model might seem crazy at present even for makers of
apps that fit the above criteria, but in case it works out well for
Overcast, they might consider it more seriously later on.

I think we haven't really figured out a good way for productivity apps
to make a sustainable recurring revenue off the App Store. So I welcome
Overcast trying out a novel and risky business model. This model could
work well for Overcast, or it might not, but either way, we'll all learn
something from how it does after adopting this model. And I'm happy that
someone who can afford to take the risk to experiment on this, is doing
so.

Photoshop CC and Office 365 have been using subscription-based pricing
successfully, but the current perception is that indie apps are not
complex enough or useful enough to charge every month. If it works out,
maybe Overcast's patronage-based subscription model can pave the way for
compelling indie apps to switch to subscription-based pricing.

### Does it make other podcast apps unviable?

For podcast apps, possibly the biggest competitor is Apple's Podcasts
app. It gets prominent placement in the App Store, and the vast majority
of iPhone-using podcast-listeners probably use that. For indie apps to
survive sustainably in such a category, they essentially have to be
[opinionated][] (and the popular ones are). If a podcast-listener is in
the market for a third-party app, there's a good chance that she has
developed a particular pattern of listening that is not necessarily
served well by every app in the market. Overcast works for some, and
doesn't for some others.

When Overcast launched last year, Oisín Prendiville (who works on
Castro) [said][oisin]:

His point is that a free third-party podcast app expands the market for
third-party podcast apps in general, and that remains true with Overcast
going patronage-based as well.

A few days back, Pádraig Kennedy (who works on Castro as well)
[said][padraig]:

Overcast's business model can't just make the other paid indie podcast
apps go bust or become irrelevant. While I can't state a prediction as
fact, I believe it's highly unlikely that other podcast apps wind down
because of this one move.

### To conclude

I don't know if Marco's stated motivation for this business model --
that VC money is poised to enter the podcasting industry -- is plausible
or valid. But I welcome experiments in figuring out alternative business
models for indie iOS apps, and I'd be very interested to see how this
works out for Overcast.
