Microsoft will be [acquiring] the devices business of Nokia early next
year. There won't be any Nokia smartphones anymore. (Though legally,
Nokia can use the Nokia brand on their own mobile phones, if they make
any, in 2016.) Microsoft will most likely sell the S40 phones as "Nokia
Asha"s, but the high-end devices will probably become "Microsoft
Lumia"s. 

This acquisition, at this price, does imply that Nokia's strategy to put
all their eggs in the Windows Phone basket has not worked. I say that
with the advantage of hindsight, but to be fair, let's look back at the
time when Nokia made that decision.

The [burning-platform memo] of Feb 08, 2011 said:

 > The first iPhone shipped in 2007, and we still don't have a product
 > that is close to their experience. Android came on the scene just
 > over 2 years ago, and this week they took our leadership position in
 > smartphone volumes. Unbelievable.
 > 
 > We have some brilliant sources of innovation inside Nokia, but we are
 > not bringing it to market fast enough. We thought MeeGo would be a
 > platform for winning high-end smartphones. However, at this rate, by
 > the end of 2011, we might have only one MeeGo product in the market.

and then, at the end of the memo:

 > We are working on a path forward -- a path to rebuild our market
 > leadership. When we share the new strategy on February 11, it will be
 > a huge effort to transform our company.

And sure enough, the strategy unveiled on Feb 11, 2011 was that 
[Nokia would adopt Windows Phone] as its principal smartphone OS. In the
long term, Symbian and MeeGo devices would get ramped-down.

I fully agree with Stephen Elop's assessment of the situation in the
memo.  Incremental advancements were not going to cut it. Nokia needed
to do something completely different, something that was capable of
being disruptive. Nokia had to pull off a [purple cow].

At that time, my pal [Girish speculated] that Nokia had chosen to run
with Windows Phone probably because of the state at which MeeGo appeared
to be at that time. It seemed then that MeeGo was far from being ready,
and the user experience it offered was severely lacking in several
areas.

Fast-forward eight months. The N9 shipped in Sep 2011, [to][review1]
[fantastic][review2] [reviews][review3]. It was heralded as a bold step,
in both hardware and software, that set it apart both from not just the
Nokia smartphones of that time, but from any smartphone shipped till
then. Every review of the N9 I've seen is over-the-top, and points out
that MeeGo being a dead-end platform was pretty much the only major
downside of the device. And lack of apps, which was the result of it
being a dead-end.

It's notable that Nokia shipped its first MeeGo device _before_ its
first Windows Phone device. Here is a timeline of how things panned out:

 * **Sep 2010**: [Stephen Elop is CEO]
 * **Oct 2010**: First Symbian^3 devices ship ([N8] and [C7])
 * **Feb 2011**: [Burning-platform memo]; [Adopting Windows Phone] as principal mobile OS
 * **Apr 2011**: [Agreement with Microsoft] - Nokia to receive "billions of dollars".
 * **Sep 2011**: First Nokia MeeGo device ships ([N9]);
             First Nokia Belle devices ship ([700 and 701])
 * **Nov 2011**: First Nokia Windows Phone device ships ([Lumia 800])

So, despite MeeGo being pretty good, why did Nokia pick Windows Phone as
its purple cow? Apart from jokes about moles and Trojan horses, the
following hypotheses are possibile answers to that question:

 - **Hypothesis #1**: Nokia underestimated MeeGo's quality and/or
   time-to-market. By the time they realized that it was an
   underestimation, Nokia had already entered into an agreement with
   Microsoft that involved receiving "billions of dollars", so it was
   obliged to keep the Microsoft engagement going.

 - **Hypothesis #2**: Nokia didn't doubt that they could ship a quality
   MeeGo device in time, but valued the ecosystem of apps and services
   more than owning the full hardware-software stack of their
   smartphones.

 - **Hypothesis #3**: Nokia didn't think they could follow up the N9
   with more MeeGo devices quickly. (Why that would be, I have no idea.
   So this hypothesis is probably an unlikely one.)

What the [burning-platform memo] says on the topic of ecosystems makes
me incline towards hypothesis #2:

 > The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems, where
 > ecosystems include not only the hardware and software of the device,
 > but developers, applications, ecommerce, advertising, search, social
 > applications, location-based services, unified communications and
 > many other things. Our competitors aren't taking our market share
 > with devices; they are taking our market share with an entire
 > ecosystem. This means we're going to have to decide how we either
 > build, catalyse or join an ecosystem.

At the time of the memo, Nokia did have its strength in some parts of
the ecosystem (a great developer community around Qt and a good map
service), but was quite behind in others (third-party apps, social apps,
searching). Frankly, Windows Phone wasn't exactly enjoying a great app
ecosystem back then, but it had a better chance of garnering one.

I think Nokia considered it so important to have an ecosystem, and was
not confident of being able to build one all by itself (like Apple did)
that it was prepared to throw away its in-house OS.

Is an ecosystem _that_ important? Probably yes, I think, for the big
guys who need to sell millions of devices per year to even stay in
business. And if the ecosystem is that important, it means that
BlackBerry doesn't really have a chance either.
