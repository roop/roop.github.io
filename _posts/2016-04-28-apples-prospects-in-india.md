In the Q&A after Apple's [Q2 2016 earnings call][imore], Tim Cook
answered a question on India in detail.

Katy Huberty asked:

In his answer, Tim Cook first refuted the "growth has to come from
new markets" argument:

> ... With our worldwide share, there's still quite a bit of room in the
> developed markets as well.

and then talked about what Apple thinks of the Indian market:

I think Tim Cook's outlook on the Indian market is a little too
optimistic.

Firstly, iPhone sales in India were never really hampered by the
unavailability of LTE (or 4G as they call it here in India). Anyone who
can afford an iPhone in India has access to a fast broadband internet
either at home or at work, probably both. The LTE rollout speeded up
only this year here in India (earlier, only one network operator,
Airtel, offered LTE), but LTE support is a standard feature among
high-end devices being sold here for a while. At present, LTE is supported
by even sub-$150 devices from big brands. The spread of LTE in India is
not going to suddenly make iPhones more desirable, nor is there any
significant upgrade cycle coming because of LTE.

Second, Tim Cook says there are "many, many different small shops" in
India, but I doubt those shops can contribute much to iPhone sales. Most
of the potential iPhone owners are in the cities, where Apple has been
partnering with [premium resellers](http://www.apple.com/in/buy/apr/)
&ndash; retail outlets that try to give an Apple-Store-ish feel.

I have no guesses on what Apple might have started regarding retail in
the "last few weeks". As to what happened in the "last 18 months", Kunal
Dua of NDTV [hazards a guess][ndtv]:

> in terms of selling the iPhone below the official MRP [Maximum Retail
> Price], a standard practice for the rest of the industry.

Third, India is indeed looking a bit like how China was in 2005 [in terms of
GDP per
capita](https://www.google.co.in/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&idim=country:CHN:IND),
but India has far less number of people who can afford an iPhone than
China does. The addressable market for Apple in India is tiny, and is
growing quite slowly [^pew]. Of that, those who can afford the current
year flagship will constitute a minuscule number compared to China.

As Ben Thompson [explains][stratechery]:

> [In China] a relatively small number of individuals have an outsized
> share of income, but, because China is so huge, the absolute number of
> high income individuals is quite large.
>
> India, on the hand, is just about as large as China, but has a very
> different economic profile.
> 
> ...
> 
> The average [income] is lower and there are fewer outliers, which mean
> many fewer people are in iPhone territory.

It doesn't help that iPhone's launch prices in India are some of the
highest in the world. Also, India's smartphone market is already
dominated by Android handsets, so many apps and services launch
Android-first, and sometimes stay Android-only.

India does have a market for premium smartphones, but it's quite small.
India can be a good potential market for previous-year iPhones and for
refurbished iPhones, and Apple is making efforts on both fronts. Given this
scenario, from Apple's perspective, India isn't like the China
opportunity at all.

[^pew]: According to [Pew Research][pew], less than 2% of Indians earn >$20 a day (or ~$7000 a year) as of 2011, an increase of about 0.5% over 10 years. In China, the number of people who earn >$20 increased by 5% in the same period.
