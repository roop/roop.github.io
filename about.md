When creating software, I design the user experience,
write the code and create a lot of the graphics. I take the
effort to make it great software.

### Apps I made

 * [Hide & Seek][]: A Safari content blocker to improve privacy on your web searches
 * [Bisect][]: A split-screen Markdown editor for the iPad [[Retired](http://roopc.net/posts/2016/sunsetting-bisect/)]

### Related work

 * I used to write a [weekly summary][lwise] on the evolution of Swift.
 * I [found and fixed a bug in Webkit][webkit_bugfix], thereby enabling
   content blocking to work correctly in some scenarios (including one
   that Hide & Seek had ran into)
 * I wrote and implemented a parser specification for Markdown called
   [vfmd].

### Earlier

In the past, I have worked with Nokia, KDE, Hyves and other customers as
part of a Qt consultancy company called ForwardBias Technologies. During
that time, I created [Notekeeper][], the Evernote client for
Meego-Harmattan and Symbian.  Prior to that, I worked for Texas
Instruments as an EDA engineer.
