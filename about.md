When creating software, I design the user experience,
write the code and create a lot of the graphics. I take the
effort to make it great software.

Presently, I'm working on my first iPad application. Earlier this year,
I wrote and implemented a parser specfication for Markdown called
[vfmd][].

In the past, I have worked with Nokia, KDE, Hyves and other customers
as part of [a Qt consultancy company]. During that time, I created
[Notekeeper][], the Evernote client for Meego-Harmattan and Symbian.
Prior to that, I worked for Texas Instruments as an EDA engineer.
