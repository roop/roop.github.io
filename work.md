<h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>

  * **Calligra**: I introduced a few rich-text handling features like [drop caps](https://github.com/KDE/calligra/search?utf8=✓&q=drop+caps+author%3Aroop&type=Commits) and [tab stops](https://github.com/KDE/calligra/search?utf8=✓&q=tab+author%3Aroop&type=Commits)
    to KOffice/Calligra's word processor.

  * **Qt Creator**: I [added](https://github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator/search?q=tab+author%3Aroop&type=Commits&utf8=✓) a way to automatically infer whether to
    expand tabs or not. My contribution was enhanced by other contributors and eventually became
    the 'Mixed' option under Settings > Text Editor > Behavior > Tab
    policy.

<h2>As a C++ developer</h2>

<h3>vfmd parser</h3>

A parser in C++ that conforms to the vfmd Markdown spec, with support
for extensions.

<h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>

   * **Webkit**: I found and fixed [a bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149873)
   in the content blocking feature in Webkit.

<h2>As a spec designer</h2>

<h3>vfmd</h3>

vfmd is a variant of John Gruber's Markdown with a unambiguous parser
specification of the syntax.
