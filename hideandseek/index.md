Hide & Seek lets you search in Google and Bing as an
anonymous user, and simultaneously use their other services,
like Gmail and Outlook as a logged in user. You can do this
without having to use Private Browsing.

With both Google and Microsoft, if you're logged into one service,
you're logged into all of them. For example, if you use
Gmail on the browser, you become automatically logged in when you
use Google search. This means that Google can (and does) associate
your search query with your Google account. To counter this,
you can use Hide & Seek to hide your identity in Google search,
while still staying logged into Gmail.

Before using Hide & Seek, you need to think about which
Google and Bing services you can use logged out. Then,
configure Hide & Seek to hide your identity in those services.
After that, you can search as usual and your searches will
be performed as a logged out user. You can simultaneously
use other Google or Microsft services (like Gmail or Outlook)
in other tabs as a logged in user.

Some caveats:

  - When you&rsquo;d like to follow a Google search result, if you&rsquo;d like to
    hide that action from Google, use the 'Open in New Tab'
    option rather than tapping on a result directly.
  - When using Google Images search on the iPad, when Hide & Seek
    is hiding your identity for that search, to visit the origin
    website of the image, you will have to use the 'Open in New Tab'
    option rather than tapping on a result directly.

Hide & Seek will be available soon for 64-bit iPhones and iPads running
iOS 9.
