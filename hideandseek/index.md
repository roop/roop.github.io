<h1>Hide &amp; Seek</h1>

<aside class="roop-intro">
<p>A Safari content blocker extension to improve your
privacy when making web searches</p>
</aside>

Hide & Seek lets you search in Google and Bing as an
anonymous user, and simultaneously use their other services,
like Gmail and Outlook as a logged in user. You can do this
without having to use Private Browsing.

With both Google and Microsoft, if you're logged into one service,
you're logged into all of them. For example, if you use
Gmail on the browser, you become automatically logged in when you
use Google search. This means that Google can (and does) associate
your search query with your Google account. To counter this,
you can use Hide & Seek to hide your identity in Google search,
while still staying logged into Gmail.

Hide & Seek supports hiding your identity in:

  - Google Web Search
  - Google Images search
  - Google Videos search
  - Bing web search
  - Bing images search
  - Bing videos search
  - Bing news

Before using Hide & Seek, you'll have to decide which Google and Bing services
you'd like to use logged out. Then, configure Hide & Seek to hide your
identity in those services. After that, you can search as usual and
your searches will be performed as a logged out user. You can
simultaneously use other Google or Microsoft services (like Gmail or
Outlook) in other tabs as a logged in user.

Some caveats:

  - On the iPhone / iPad: When you'd like to follow a Google search
    result, if you'd like to hide that action from Google, use the 'Open
    in New Tab' option rather than tapping on a result directly.
  - On the iPad: When using Google Images search and when Hide & Seek is
    hiding your identity for that search, to visit the origin website of
    the image, you will have to use the 'Open in New Tab' option rather
    than tapping on a result directly.
