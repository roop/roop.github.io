<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

<aside class="roop-intro">
<p>Hide &amp; Seek is a Safari content blocker extension to improve your
privacy when making web searches</p>
</aside>

<p>Hide &amp; Seek works by providing a WebKit Content Blocker extension
to the Safari browser on your device. Hide &amp; Seek does not know
which web pages you visit, or even which web pages had their cookies
blocked because of Hide &amp; Seek.</p>

<p>Hide &amp; Seek prepares a list of rules based on your Hide &amp;
Seek configuration, and provides the list to Safari. Safari uses this
list of rules while you browse the Internet to determine whether cookies
should be blocked on a particular page or not. Hide &amp; Seek is not
consulted when you browse the Internet, and therefore, Hide &amp; Seek
does not know anything about your browsing activity.</p>

<p>Hide &amp; Seek does not send your Hide &amp; Seek configuration
data, or anything else for that matter, to any external server on the
Internet.</p>
