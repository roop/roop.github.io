## Qt consulting

In 2008, I quit my job at Texas Intruments India to start a Qt
consultancy company called ForwardBias Technologies with [Girish].
Girish had just returned to India after working for TrollTech on the Qt
toolkit.

These are some of the stuff I worked on while at ForwardBias.

### KDE
 
Girish and myself worked on adding Open Document Format support to
KDE's word processor, on a project
[sponsored](https://nlnet.nl/project/odf-koffice/) by the NLNet
Foundation.
 
My contributions included introducing [drop caps](https://github.com/KDE/calligra/search?utf8=✓&q=drop+caps+author%3Aroop&type=Commits) and [tab stops](https://github.com/KDE/calligra/search?utf8=✓&q=tab+author%3Aroop&type=Commits) to the word processor.

The drop caps feature was particularly challenging, requiring changes to
the core text layouting code.

### Wimba

I created a library that can parse SVG snippets into Qt graphics
objects.

### Hyves Desktop
 
Girish and I made a photo-uploader desktop application for Hyves,
which used to be a full-fledged Dutch social network at that time.
 
I was the primary developer for a fun photo-editing mode -- where you
can add captions, filters and stickers to photos -- which I demo in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZzzVtbNVw).
