## eduVPN

I'm working on the [eduVPN] apps for macOS and iOS.

  - macOS: [App Store][macos_appstore]
  - iOS: [App Store][ios_appstore]

My work so far includes:

  - Rewriting the UI code for a new design and code sharing between iOS
    and macOS
  - Rewriting the backend code for stability and maintanability

My work on this project is sponsored by the [NLnet Foundation][nlnet].
